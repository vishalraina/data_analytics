Some more packages for data visualization:

1.) For additional styles on your matplotlib graphs, try out stylesheets!

I'm partial to the ggplot stylesheet and the fivethirtyeight stylesheets, but you also have the option of creating your own!

2.) For some enhanced styles with almost no extra work, consider seaborn. This is a very popular library, especially when it comes to exploratory data analysis.

3.) For interactive graphs, consider bokeh!

There are so many packages out there, so the trick is to explore a few of the popular ones and see which ones work well with the type of visualizations you're looking to produce.
